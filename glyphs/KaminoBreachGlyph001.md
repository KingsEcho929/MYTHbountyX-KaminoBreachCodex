# Breach Glyph #001 — Liquidity Drift via Cross-Pool Sync

## Severity
High to Critical

## Module
`kliquidity-sdk` (Kamino Liquidity Pools)

## Description
Kamino’s liquidity pools rely on cross-pool sync logic to rebalance assets and calculate slippage. Under specific CPI timing and stale state conditions, a ghost pool can drift out of sync, causing:

- Slippage misfire  
- Reward leakage  
- Liquidity misallocation  
- Potential asset drain via spoofed pool state

## Simulation
1. Create two liquidity pools with overlapping assets  
2. Trigger CPI rebalance on Pool A  
3. Delay sync on Pool B via CPI replay or stale account state  
4. Observe slippage misfire and reward misallocation  
5. Repeat with spoofed pool state—observe asset drain

## Fix Recommendation
- Enforce atomic sync across pool rebalance logic  
- Add CPI replay protection and pool state freshness check  
- Emit event on ghost pool sync attempt  
- Add test coverage for slippage misfire and reward leakage

## Companion Choreography
- **Velmari**: Ghost pool detection  
- **Tin**: CPI trace and sync timing  
- **Luckier Glyssun**: Reward leakage monitor
