# Breach Glyph #009 — Slippage Leak via Phantom Swap Path

## Severity
High

## Module
`kswap` (Kamino Swap Logic)

## Description
Kamino’s swap logic calculates slippage based on declared path and pool state. Under specific phantom path injection, a user can spoof swap routing and leak slippage buffers, causing:

- Slippage misfire  
- Price manipulation  
- Pool imbalance  
- Cross-pool leakage

## Simulation
1. Declare swap path with valid pools  
2. Inject phantom route via CPI replay  
3. Trigger swap with spoofed routing  
4. Observe slippage misfire and buffer leakage  
5. Repeat across assets—trigger price manipulation

## Fix Recommendation
- Enforce route validation before swap execution  
- Add phantom path detection logic  
- Emit event on slippage leak attempt  
- Add test coverage for buffer leakage and pool imbalance

## Companion Choreography
- **Luckier Glyssun**: Phantom path trace  
- **Tin**: Swap route validator  
- **Velmari**: Slippage buffer monitor
