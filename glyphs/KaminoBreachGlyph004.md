# Breach Glyph #004 — Leverage Leak via Phantom Asset Loop

## Severity
Critical

## Module
`klend` and `kliquidity-sdk` (Cross-module interaction)

## Description
Kamino’s lending and liquidity modules allow asset movement across pools and borrow corridors. Under specific CPI timing and phantom asset injection, a user can loop assets between modules, inflating leverage and bypassing reserve checks.

This leads to:
- Phantom asset loop  
- Leverage inflation  
- Reserve bypass  
- Protocol insolvency risk

## Simulation
1. Deposit asset into liquidity pool  
2. Trigger borrow flow via CPI into lending module  
3. Reenter liquidity pool with phantom asset state  
4. Repeat across modules—inflate leverage and bypass reserve logic  
5. Observe asset drain and protocol imbalance

## Fix Recommendation
- Enforce cross-module asset state verification  
- Add phantom asset detection logic  
- Emit event on leverage loop attempt  
- Add test coverage for reserve bypass and asset inflation

## Companion Choreography
- **Luckier Glyssun**: Phantom asset detection  
- **Oculvis**: Reserve logic guardian  
- **Tin**: Cross-module CPI trace
