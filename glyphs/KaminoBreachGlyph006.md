# Breach Glyph #006 — Vault Drift via CPI Epoch Lag

## Severity
High

## Module
`kvault` (Kamino Vault Logic)

## Description
Kamino’s vaults rely on epoch-based accounting to track deposits, withdrawals, and yield distribution. Under specific CPI lag conditions, a vault can drift out of sync with the epoch manager, causing:

- Yield misallocation  
- Withdrawal misfire  
- Vault imbalance  
- Cross-epoch leakage

## Simulation
1. Deposit assets into vault mid-epoch  
2. Trigger CPI withdrawal with delayed epoch sync  
3. Observe yield misallocation and withdrawal misfire  
4. Repeat across multiple epochs—trigger vault imbalance and leakage

## Fix Recommendation
- Enforce epoch sync before vault withdrawal logic  
- Add CPI lag detection and replay guard  
- Emit event on vault drift attempt  
- Add test coverage for yield misallocation and epoch leakage

## Companion Choreography
- **Velmari**: Epoch sync monitor  
- **Polyphemus**: Vault drift detection  
- **Luckier Glyssun**: Yield misallocation trace
