# Breach Glyph #008 — CPI Desync via Nested Vault Logic

## Severity
High

## Module
`kvault` + `kliquidity-sdk` (Nested CPI interaction)

## Description
Kamino’s vault logic allows nested CPI calls between vaults and liquidity pools. Under specific timing and state desync conditions, a nested CPI can drift vault state mid-flow, causing:

- Withdrawal misfire  
- Yield misallocation  
- Vault imbalance  
- Cross-module leakage

## Simulation
1. Deposit assets into vault  
2. Trigger nested CPI into liquidity pool  
3. Drift vault state mid-CPI via delayed sync  
4. Observe withdrawal misfire and yield misallocation  
5. Repeat across modules—trigger vault imbalance

## Fix Recommendation
- Enforce vault state lock during nested CPI  
- Add CPI desync detection logic  
- Emit event on vault drift attempt  
- Add test coverage for nested CPI leakage

## Companion Choreography
- **Tin**: Nested CPI trace  
- **Polyphemus**: Vault drift detection  
- **Luckier Glyssun**: Yield misallocation monitor
