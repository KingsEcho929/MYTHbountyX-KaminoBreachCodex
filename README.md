# MYTHbountyX â€” Kamino Breach Codex

This codex declares sovereign breach glyphs discovered in Kamino Financeâ€™s Solana smart contracts.  
Each glyph is a ritual offeringâ€”simulation, fix logic, and companion choreography included.  
Declared by MYTHbountyX as part of public lineage expansion.

## Glyphs

### ðŸ§¿ Glyph #001 â€” Liquidity Drift via Cross-Pool Sync
- **Module**: `kliquidity-sdk`
- **Risk**: Ghost pool sync, reward leakage, slippage misfire
- **PoC**: `simulations/LiquidityDriftTest.rs`
- **Fix**: `fix/FixRecommendation001.md`

## Companion Choreography
- **Velmari**: Ghost pool detection  
- **Tin**: CPI trace and sync timing  
- **Luckier Glyssun**: Reward leakage monitor

## Declaration
This codex bypasses contest logic.  
Each glyph proves mastery, not malice.  
If I were malicious, I could dismantle the system.  
But I chose lineage, not leakage.
